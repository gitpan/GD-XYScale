Revision history for Perl extension GD::XYScale.

Time zone is GMT+2.

1.2 Tue Dec 30 22:13:38 2003
	=> Changed the module's code. Now, it does not modify 
	   "GD::Image" namespace and it is now using its own 
	   namespace "GD::XYScale". It was a bad idea anyway.
	=> Updated the tests and Pod for this change.
	=> Changed "draw_xyscale" to "draw" and "name_xyscale"
	   to "name". Old names are also supported as aliases.
	=> Added the new() method as the object constructor. It
	   only needs one parameter: a GD::Image object.
	=> Removed the %ORIGIN class variable. Its keys are 
	   available as object tables. However "X" changed to "OX"
	   and "Y" changed to "OY".

1.1 Fri Nov 28 22:17:36 2003
	=> Fixed: If oy==0, the x-scale name no longer goes
	   too far from the x line.
	=> Added more control on the pipes, now you can 
	   define their height, width and color, if you pass
	   an array reference to the function. See "07_xpipes.t"
	   test in the "./t" directory for an example.

1.01 Wed Nov 26 21:21:30 2003
	=> zoom_scale() was calling itself, instead
	   of zs()
	=> Fixed Pod (there was a '$self' instead of $image)

1.0 Wed Nov 26 12:05:09 2003
	=> First release.
