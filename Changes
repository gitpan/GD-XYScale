Revision history for Perl extension GD::XYScale.

Time zone is GMT+2.

1.1 Fri Nov 28 22:17:36 2003
	=> Fixed: If oy==0, the x-scale name no longer goes
	   too far from the x line.
	=> Added more control on the pipes, now you can 
	   define their height, width and color, if you pass
	   an array reference to the function. See "07_xpipes.t"
	   test in the "./t" directory for an example.

1.01 Wed Nov 26 21:21:30 2003
	=> zoom_scale() was calling itself, instead
	   of zs()
	=> Fixed Pod (there was a '$self' instead of $image)

1.0 Wed Nov 26 12:05:09 2003
	=> First release.
